                Highlanders and Otago first five-eighths Cameron Millar has had
                some early lessons in being patient in his rugby career, but
                heading into DHL Super Rugby Pacific in 2024, he is keen to make
                up for lost time.
              </div>

              <div class="article-content-body">
                <p>
                  Millar suffered a torn ligament in the early rounds of the
                  Bunnings NPC that caused a few setbacks more than usual.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "A specialist found my tibia and the bottom of my leg were
                  rubbing which was stopping a few things from healing
                  properly."
                </p>
                <p>
                  Adding to his frustration was suffering a similar injury in
                  Super Rugby Pacific and then coming back and getting into a
                  position with the prospect of a lot of minutes, only to have
                  the injury occur in his second game.
                </p>
                <p>
                  He's training three days out of five in the pre-season
                  build-up and is happy with his progress, considering there is
                  plenty of time before Super Rugby Pacific starts.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "I've gradually been working it back, but it's now where I can
                  do most activities.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "It was good having older boys around, especially during
                  rehab, giving me a few tips to keep my mind focused.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "There's quite a good vibe in the team. It's different from
                  previous pre-seasons in how we run it; everyone is upbeat now.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "The new coaches, especially Kenny [Kendrick] Lynn, have
                  changed a few of our philosophies around attack and we have
                  got some new strength and conditioning coaches, so we are
                  training, with less time on the bikes and rowers, and doing
                  more hard work on the field."
                </p>

                <p>
                  Millar has come through a remarkable era of development from
                  his home region centred on Gore, primarily through Gore High
                  School's rugby programme. The region has already produced an
                  All Black in prop Ethan de Groot, a year or two ahead of
                  Millar. Others who have emerged are his Highlanders teammates
                  Finn Hurley, Jack Taylor, Hayden Michaels and Harrison Morton.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Millar said he wasn't quite sure why things had happened their
                  way, but the group were good mates who spent lunchtimes at
                  school and weekends together, and he felt that friendship
                  resulted in them pushing each other to the level they had
                  reached.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "We're all close, went to the same schools growing up, and
                  have spent a lot of time together through the age grades."
                </p>
                <p>
                  Millar finished his schooling as part of the Otago Boys' High
                  School development programme, which he said exposed him to a
                  better level of rugby and challenged him to improve.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "It really pushed me out of my comfort zone going up to
                  Dunedin."
                </p>
                <p>
                  Since joining the Highlanders development group, he has found
                  mixing with top players to be another driver.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "It's been awesome and I feel like every first-five I've
                  played with coming up through the grades has been more than
                  willing to help."
                </p>
                <p>
                  He said it also helped that, like every other boy in New
                  Zealand, he had a player like All Blacks great Dan Carter to
                  look up to as a blueprint for playing in the position.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "It motivates you to want to try and get anywhere near his
                  level."
                </p>
                <p>
                  After his injury frustrations, motivation is not a problem as
                  he seeks to become the wearer of the No.10 jersey for the side
                  or to get as many minutes as he can on the field.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Having nearly five months out due to the ankle injury meant he
                  couldn't build on the hard work he had been putting in to
                  develop his speed.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "At the moment, I'm trying to work up to that top speed, and
                  hopefully, in a couple of weeks we can start up with that
                  programme and try and get a bit quicker."
                </p>
                <p>
                  Millar has been working with one of his conditioning coaches
                  on the mechanics of his running and said it was hard to get
                  used to and quite challenging with some of the changes
                  required, but with an end goal in mind, it was worth it to
                  stay in the process.
