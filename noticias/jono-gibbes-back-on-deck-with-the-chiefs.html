                Peripatetic former All Black lock Jono Gibbes has joined the
                Chiefs for Super Rugby Pacific next year as a resource coach and
                coach of the Chiefs' Development XV.
              </div>

              <div class="article-content-body">
                <p>
                  He has also been appointed coach of the New Zealand Under-20s
                  side.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Gibbes, 46, an eight-Test All Black, said he last played for
                  the Chiefs in 2008, but since then, the franchise had written
                  some outstanding chapters in its history, and he felt lucky to
                  be welcomed back into the fold.
                </p>
                <p>
                  His coaching record includes stints with Leinster (2008-14),
                  Clermont Auvergne (2014-17), Ulster (2017-18), director of
                  rugby for La Rochelle (2018-2021) and coach of Clermont
                  Auvergne (2021-23). He also had a year as Waikato coach in
                  2018.
                </p>
                <p>
                  He returned to New Zealand from his last coaching stint in
                  France to take a rest after 15 years of coaching. There were
                  no guarantees he would continue coaching, but he was conscious
                  his children had experienced life in France and Northern
                  Ireland and wanted them to have a Kiwi experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Gibbes said it didn't matter where you were coaching rugby; it
                  was about the game-day experience, the highs and lows that
                  occur over 80 minutes.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "I had a couple of great highlights in Europe, but, also, I
                  was lucky enough to be present at the World Cup final this
                  year, and when Sam Cane ran out of the tunnel in the final, it
                  brought me right back to the old days when I was at Rugby Park
                  and the atmosphere.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "Those things still remain relevant in our game and the
                  game-day experience is still what it is all about to me."
                </p>
                <p>
                  Gibbes is also taking on the New Zealand Under-20 coaching
                  role. He said there had been a thorough review over the past
                  few years of a group whose results had slumped from those of a
                  decade ago.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <br />One of the critical aspects was the amount of time the
                  side had to prepare. Gibbes said along with his role with the
                  Chiefs, he wanted to ensure the U-20s build-up was as thorough
                  as possible.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Liam Messam said he was thrilled to be working alongside
                  Gibbes as he had been a mentor for him when he started
                  playing.
                </p>
                <p>
                  He is working in an athlete development role, helping players
                  one-on-one to develop their skills, keeping them honest in the
                  gym and working with their U-20 players.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Accepting the position meant he finally ended his playing
                  career and was grateful for the chance he had been given in
                  the role.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Canterbury coach Marty Bourke has also joined the Chiefs as an
                  assistant coach. He said he would mix his Chiefs' and
                  Canterbury NPC roles for the next two years.
                </p>
                <p>
                  He said his chance to be involved with the Chiefs in Super
                  Rugby Pacific, a pinnacle competition, was a challenge he
                  looked forward to.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Changes have been made after the completion of the Rugby World
                  Cup cycle, and the approach with new personnel among players
                  and coaches was that last year was done and they were looking
                  at a new year.
                </p>
                <p>
                  That had to do with developing the young players coming
                  through.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "Yes, they've lost a lot of experience, but it's an
                  opportunity for those from the next tier to step up."
                </p>
                <p>
                  Bourke worked with head coach Clayton McMillan in 2019 with
                  the Bay of Plenty NPC side, and they kept in touch as their
                  respective careers developed. Bourke moved offshore to coach
                  in the United States. He returned to New Zealand as an
                  assistant coach for Canterbury, taking on the head coach role
                  in 2023.
