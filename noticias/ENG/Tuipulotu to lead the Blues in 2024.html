                            for the 2024 Super Rugby Pacific season.</div>

                        <div class="article-content-body">
                            <p>Tuipulotu, who led the side in 2019-21, said the captaincy was something he didn't take
                                lightly.</p>
                            <p>The 99-cap Blues leader said, "The feeling you get leading this side into battle each
                                week is something special.</p>
                            <p>"We've got a core of experienced Blues men who lead in their own way, and it's my job to
                                empower that group of leaders to help propel the team forward."</p>
                            <p>The honour of captaincy also brought a weight of expectation because the side represented
                                the people of the Auckland-North Harbour-Northland region, and the players sought
                                success for them every time they pulled on the jersey, he said.</p>
                            <p>"We've set ourselves high standards for the 2024 campaign, we believe we have the squad
                                to do something special and we're working hard in the pre-season to make that a
                                reality."</p>
                            <p>Incoming head coach Vern Cotter acknowledged that Tuipulotu has a strong influence on the
                                players.</p>
                            <p>"He is a natural leader in this group; he's an experienced head with nearly 100 caps and
                                has the respect of the players around him. I'm confident he'll do an excellent job.</p>
                            <p>"We've got a group of guys in our squad with a range of leadership experience, so they'll
                                provide a sounding board and help lighten the load," he said.</p>
