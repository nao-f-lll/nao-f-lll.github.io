                Blues lock Sam Darry is looking to build on his already
                impressive start in Super Rugby Pacific and be part of an
                Auckland-based unit that consistently plays to its ability in
                2024.
              </div>

              <div class="article-content-body">
                <p>
                  Darry said new coach Vern Cotter has had an early impact with
                  a hard-nosed but honest approach.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "He doesn't beat about the bush. That's exactly what we need.
                  If you're not doing something right, he'll be the first to let
                  you know, and it's awesome because you know it comes from a
                  place of care.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "He's made no bones about the fact he's come here for one
                  reason, and that's to win a championship, and we all share
                  that same sentiment."
                </p>
                <p>
                  Darry was taken nothing for granted about his contribution to
                  the side. He and All Black Patrick Tuipulotu may look like the
                  favoured locking pair. Still, with Laghlan McWhannell from the
                  Chiefs, James Thompson from Counties Manukau and Josh Beehre
                  from Auckland, there would be plenty of competition for
                  places.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "We've all had a good start to the pre-season, so it will be
                  awesome to compete with those guys and bring the best out of
                  us all week in and week out."
                </p>
                <p>
                  Darry said he was lucky the broken arm he ended the 2023
                  campaign with happened toward the end of the season. His
                  recovery occurred over the five-six weeks of the off-season,
                  which had been good.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Coping with the frustration of the injury was not an issue.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "I've been taught at the academy in Christchurch that when
                  things like injuries happen they present an opportunity, so I
                  used it as a time to unwind a wee bit from footy, to take a
                  bit of a break, mentally get refreshed and spend a bit of time
                  on my Uni work and to reset some goals and reignite the
                  passion for when I came back."
                </p>
                <p>
                  He's been doing a Bachelor of Commerce around the rugby
                  demands of the last six years and is nearing qualification.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "It gives me a way to switch off from footy and gives me
                  something to do outside of rugby that keeps my brain active.
                  Sometimes you can get too caught up in footy so it is nice to
                  come home and switch off from that and do something else."
                </p>
                <p>
                  He missed only three rounds of Canterbury's Bunnings NPC
                  campaign, and his injury had no complications, which was good.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Darry confirmed the Bunnings NPC season had been one of the
                  best in recent history.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "From a playing point of view, anyone could have beaten anyone
                  on their day. It was such a tight competition. Most of our
                  games for Canterbury were decided by two or three points and
                  decided in the last five to 10 minutes.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "You knew as a player you were in for a dogfight each week,
                  which is exciting, and it excites the players knowing every
                  week is going to be a different challenge, and we had to come
                  up with different ways to try and win the games."
                </p>
                <p>
                  There was disappointment with Canterbury missing out in the
                  semifinals.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "But, from a playing perspective, it was awesome; I enjoyed
                  it."
                </p>
                <p>
                  Darry has had no issues adapting to life in Auckland as he
                  heads into the third season of his contract with the Blues.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "I like the balance between being up here for Super and down
                  in Canterbury for the NPC. It quite refreshes you. I'm the
                  only Canterbury person in the Blues and vice-versa. You come
                  into a whole new group of teammates and a new group of
                  friends.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "You can learn so much from them that you can take up north or
                  south.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "Being up in Auckland is a bit of a change for me, I love it
                  up here and have some really good mates."
                </p>
                <p>
                  It also helped that his first year's accommodation was over
                  the road from the Blues training centre, so traffic issues
                  were not an immediate concern.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "But I love it; there's so many things you can do, whether
                  it's the beaches, fishing or whatever you're into."
                </p>
                <p>
                  One area of growth he's enjoyed has been his study of the
                  lineouts, which he has always been interested in.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "I do a lot of work watching clips looking for opportunities,
                  and I get a lot of satisfaction out of it. I love putting in
                  the work on a Sunday and Monday trying to figure out the best
                  way to create opportunities to win your ball or steal the
                  opposition's ball.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "Then the satisfaction of, even if it's not you calling, but
                  seeing it unfold on the field knowing the hard work you put in
                  at the start of the week paid off. I get a lot of enjoyment
                  out of that, and the lineout as a whole."
                </p>
                <p>
                  The interest extended to the lineout drives or special plays
                  that provide other opportunities.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "Luke Romano did a lot of work in that space for Canterbury
                  for many years, and I piggy-backed off him and tried to pick
                  up as much as I could. This year, we did a lot of work around
                  that, trying to exploit opportunities, whether through a maul
                  or a special trick play."
                </p>
                <p>
                  The beauty of his involvement stemmed from the fact that there
                  was no one-size-fits-all about the variations, with different
                  teams focusing on different areas, which boosted the need to
                  be adaptive.
