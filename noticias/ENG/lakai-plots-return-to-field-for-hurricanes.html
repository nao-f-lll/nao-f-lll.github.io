                Emerging Hurricanes loose forward Peter Lakai aims to hit the
                ground running when pre-season training resumes in January.
              </div>

              <div class="article-content-body">
                <p>
                  Lakai had welcome news soon after the Hurricanes started their
                  pre-season at the end of November when he had the cast removed
                  after he suffered a scaphoid injury.
                </p>
                <p>
                  That ended eight weeks of rehabbing, allowing him to set his
                  sights on being back in full training by Christmas.
                </p>
                <p>He said, "Everything's on track and feeling good."</p>
                <p>
                  Lakai came into the Hurricanes in 2023 after significantly
                  contributing to Wellington's 2022 Bunnings NPC and Ranfurly
                  Shield success.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "The first year was pretty surreal, not only winning the
                  Shield but ending up winning the whole thing [the NPC] was a
                  dream season. And this season, coming back in year two, I was
                  a bit older and more mature.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "The first few games I played at the start of the year, I
                  noticed the difference in the pace of the game; it was a lot
                  faster than NPC. But after the first few games, I adjusted to
                  it and look forward to making an impact in year two."
                </p>
                <p>
                  Understanding how to adapt to the faster speed was down to
                  mindset and preparation and ensuring he wasn't behind when the
                  gun fired.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Being introduced to higher levels of the game in the company
                  of World Rugby's Player of the Year in 2023, Ardie Savea, was
                  inspiring.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "He's been great. He's the best player in the world but he's a
                  better man off it [the field] as well. He was real good with
                  me, helping me off the field, not just for rugby, but asking
                  me how I was off-field-wise. He's someone I look up to and I'm
                  going to miss him this coming season."
                </p>
                <p>
                  Lakai said the pressure of lifting in Savea's absence would be
                  a shared experience for the side because, with several
                  long-time players having left, there was a need for everyone
                  to accept the challenge.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "We're a lot younger as a team, but for me, it's just trying
                  to implement my game. Not much changes; we've still got some
                  good leaders in the team with Dupes [Du'Plessis Kirifi] and
                  Jordie [Barrett], so we should be sweet."
                </p>
                <p>
                  Clark Laidlaw's introduction as coach was familiar to Lakai as
                  he was involved in the New Zealand Under-20s earlier in the
                  year.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "He brings a different style to our previous coach [Jason
                  Holland]. Clarky is hands on and into his team connection
                  stuff. He fits well into the team."
                </p>
                <p>
                  Lakai has also enjoyed the benefits of the Hurricanes'
                  training facility in Trentham, which shares the New Zealand
                  Campus of Innovation and Sport premises.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "The boys are in there pretty much the whole day, even on
                  weekends. There's saunas, pools, cold pools which is helpful,
                  especially in pre-season when the running load is high and the
                  boys are using the facilities to get things right. And it's
                  very helpful with injury prevention."
                </p>
                <p>
                  It's a positive sports environment offering connections with
                  the Phoenix men's and women's squads training there, and the
                  Black Ferns are in and out while Sweden's team used it as a
                  base during the FIFA Women's World Cup, and age-grade teams
                  float in and out on occasions.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Lakai said living a life that appealed to him as a youth
                  working through his teenage years was a dream come true.
                </p>
                <p>
                  To other young guys, I would say, keep working hard and take
                  each opportunity with both hands. That's what I've tried to
                  do. I'm here now but still have a long way to go.
                </p>
                <p>
                  During those early years, Lakai looked beyond rugby to compete
                  in a summer sport, especially taking on athletics and putting
                  the shot. He did well enough to win a North Island Under-14
                  shotput championship.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "I needed something to do in the summer and shotput was there
                  and had a few cracks at it and was decent at it. It probably
                  didn't directly impact my rugby but you need a bit of power to
                  throw that thing weighing 5kgs or so 13-odd metres. A bit of
                  explosiveness was needed."
                </p>
                <p>
                  And that explosiveness remains one of the qualities he brings
                  to the game.
