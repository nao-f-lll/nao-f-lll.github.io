                Rising Chiefs halfback Cortez Ratima will have plenty of
                incentives in DHL Super Rugby Pacific game preparation in 2024.
              </div>

              <div class="article-content-body">
                <p>
                  With All Blacks halfback Aaron Smith having severed his
                  connection with New Zealand and fellow All Black and Chief
                  Brad Weber also overseas, there is more scope for younger
                  halfbacks to push their claims for higher honours than for
                  several seasons.
                </p>
                <p>
                  And each Chief's halfback will be keen to build significant
                  combinations with first five-eighths Damian McKenzie.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Ratima, 22, said it was a case for the halfbacks to find their
                  way through the issue.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "I remember Brad said in an interview that he had played with
                  him for eight or 10 years and he still didn't know what Damian
                  was going to do. You just adapt and try to react whatever he
                  calls because he makes the magic happen."
                </p>
                <p>
                  But Ratima's immediate goal is more pressing. He is returning
                  to pre-season training, having recovered from a high-ankle
                  sprain that kept him off his feet for eight weeks.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "I've just been trying to get that right, and the body right,
                  for pre-season training. They're an annoying type of injury, I
                  couldn't get out and do any running. I've been stuck on the
                  bike for the last eight weeks. It's been good to start running
                  again."
                </p>

                <p>
                  He's hopeful he's on track to tick all the required boxes
                  before Christmas, allowing him to return after the break to
                  get stuck into the pre-season build-up.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Having been involved with the Chiefs in Super Rugby Pacific
                  since the start of the 2022 campaign, he knows how important
                  it is to be in a competitive place when the season kicks off
                  in February.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The strength of halfback numbers in the Chiefs region means it
                  is a constant battle to impress the selectors to claim at
                  least a place in the match day 23 and a starting place at
                  best.
                </p>
                <p>
                  And if he thought any relief might be on the horizon with the
                  departure of Weber, the signing of former All Black Te Toiroa
                  Tahuriorangi put paid to that.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The pair and Xavier Roe form a quality trio to ensure the
                  pressure is on for places in the side.
                </p>
                <p>But he acknowledges the value of having that competition.</p>
                <p>
                  "I'm looking forward to the year, putting my best foot forward
                  and competing at training, and let the coaches do their job."
                </p>
                <p>
                  The King Country-born Ratima said Super Rugby was enjoyable
                  with the chances to be part of the squad and have some perks
                  in travelling to Australia to play.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "Everyone makes you feel welcome, so these last two years have
                  been awesome to be part of."
                </p>
                <p>
                  While he has played internationally with the New Zealand
                  Under-20s, the New Zealand Māori Under-20s and the NZ
                  Secondary Schools Sevens, getting to Ireland and England with
                  the New Zealand XV in 2022 has been a boost.
                </p>

                <p>
                  "It was my first time going away with a New Zealand side, and
                  I enjoyed being around the high-performance players to learn
                  from them. Being around TJ [Perenara] and Cam [Roigard] was
                  there as well, it was awesome to be in that environment and
                  get a taste of what it is like."
                </p>
                <p>
                  Roigard, who has featured prominently as an opponent from
                  Counties Manukau during their age-group years, has provided an
                  example of the opportunities ahead for the likes of Ratima,
                  and he had set a template for pushing for higher honours.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Ratima has been compared to Perenara and former All Black and
                  Chiefs halfback Tawera Kerr-Barlow in his playing style. He
                  said he kept an eye on Perenara when younger, but being a
                  Chiefs supporter, he looked up to and saw Barlow play more
                  often.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Barlow had taken up a position in France before Ratima emerged
                  with the Chiefs, but whenever Barlow was back, he dropped into
                  the Chiefs. Ratima enjoyed talking to him and picking up any
                  gold nuggets he dropped off in halfback play.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Being a traditional post-World Cup season in 2024, Ratima said
                  he was excited to see what younger players sitting behind
                  those departing players can produce when they get their
                  chances.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "I'm sure they're ready to go and rearing to get the
                  opportunity to play good minutes."
