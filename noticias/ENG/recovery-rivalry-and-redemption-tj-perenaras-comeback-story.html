                Recovering from the Achilles tendon injury he suffered in the
                25-25 draw with England at the end of 2022, halfback TJ Perenara
                has signalled that regaining his All Blacks jersey is his
                long-term goal.
              </div>

              <div class="article-content-body">
                <p>
                  But first, he wants to build on his 70 per cent recovery to
                  get on the field and play good rugby for the Hurricanes in
                  Super Rugby Pacific.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "I set my goals broad for a year, then narrow them down to my
                  short-term goals. My short-term goal is to get back and do
                  full-team training.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "When I come to that point, and I'm team-training and looking
                  to start playing again, those goals start to adapt."
                </p>
                <p>
                  Perenara said he hoped to see more improvement in his leg when
                  the Hurricanes return to training after the holiday break.
                </p>
                <p>He knew he had to play good rugby to achieve his goals.</p>
                <p>
                  "You have to be out on the field, you have to be having an
                  impact on your team, and winning really helps too. All those
                  elements will be a part of those goals and those standards."
                </p>
                <p>
                  He said he thought he had been kicked in the back of his leg
                  when the injury occurred in the late stages of the All Blacks'
                  draw with England at Twickenham.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "I turned around, and Hoskins [Sotutu] was there. I had a go
                  at him. He said, 'I didn't touch you'."
                </p>
                <p>
                  A potential impediment to his plans is the emergence, in his
                  absence, of Cameron Roigard.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Perenara said Roigard enjoyed a fantastic season by taking his
                  chance in Perenara's absence to stake his claim for Rugby
                  World Cup selection. He was among the top-performing halfbacks
                  in New Zealand and the world.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Perenara said his approach was for the pair to compete among
                  themselves to be the two best halfbacks in the country.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "To have that dynamic working together, whatever that looks
                  like out on the field is important for us winning this
                  competition."
                </p>
                <p>
                  Some might try to paint their relationship negatively, but it
                  would be competitive.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "Both of us want to play big minutes which is a good thing.
                  Both of us want the other person to be playing really well,
                  too."
