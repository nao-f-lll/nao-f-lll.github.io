                Former Highlander and Māori All Blacks lock Tom Franklin will
                return to DHL Super Rugby Pacific with the Force in 2024.
              </div>

              <div class="article-content-body">
                <p>
                  Franklin, 33, joined the side during their Christmas break,
                  having come off a successful Bunnings NPC campaign with
                  national champion Taranaki last year.
                </p>
                <p>
                  His signing boosts an area of concern for the Force, their
                  locking strength. He played 85 times for the Highlanders, made
                  nine appearances for the Māori between 2014 and 19, and has
                  also played in Japan for Kobelco Steelers.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Force coach Simon Cron said Franklin would immediately improve
                  the quality and experience of locking for the side.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "An area that we're light on has been lock, so we've been
                  looking for somebody who can add value to the team straight
                  away.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "Tom has knowledge around lineouts and skills around the park,
                  and most recently, he was in the winning-Taranaki team at the
                  NPC level. Talking to his forwards coach, he was a big part of
                  that.
                </p>

                <p>
                  "I coached against Tom when he was at the Highlanders, and he
                  was one of the best defensive lineout readers that we'd coach
                  again. I was lucky to chat with him in Japan when he played
                  for Kobe, and you could see what he added.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "With the age of our tight-five forwards, we needed somebody a
                  bit more experienced. Tom brings a high-skill, high-paced game
                  with a good rugby brain and good knowledge.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "He's also an awesome person who'll help bring through a lot
                  of our guys and play at the highest level still."
                </p>
                <p>
                  Franklin said he was happy with the chance to play in Perth.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "I had a good chat to Crono and the coaches which excited me
                  about the move, and I heard good things from ex-players like
                  Marcel Brache who spoke about how the club is growing.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "I'm excited about the opportunity to be part of something
                  with high aspirations to go to the next level, and excited to
                  be back in Super Rugby Pacific and take on the challenge."
